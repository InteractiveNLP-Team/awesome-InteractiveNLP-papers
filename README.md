## What is Interactive NLP?

**Interactive Natural Language Processing (iNLP)** considers language models as agents capable of observing, acting, and receiving feedback in a loop with external objects such as humans, knowledge bases, tools, models, and environments, where: 

- **Observation** involves all kinds of inputs to language models. 
- **Action** involves all kinds of outputs of language models such as text generation, requesting for external objects, text editing, etc. 
- **Feedback** involves feedback messages passed from external objects to language models such as scoring from humans.

In iNLP, language models can interact with four kinds of objects (i.e., entities): 

- interact with **humans** for better understanding and addressing user needs, personalizing responses, aligning with human values, and improving the overall user experience;
- interact with **knowledge bases** for enriching language representations with factual knowledge, enhancing the contextual relevance of responses, and dynamically leveraging external information to generate more accurate and informed responses;
- interact with **models/tools** for effectively decomposing and addressing complex tasks, leveraging specialized expertise for specific subtasks, and fostering the simulation of social behaviors;
- interact with **environments** for learning grounded representations of language, and effectively tackling embodied tasks such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making in response to environmental observations.
